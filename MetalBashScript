# Step 3: Run METAL
  + All datasets being meta analyzed were QC'd with GWASInspector, so they should all have the same column names
  + I made up the "MOCK" INPUT file for this since you can't meta analyze a single dataset. In your case, you should add the ===DESCRIBE...== for every file you are meta analyzing! Other than that, you'll only change the 'OUTFILE' to match the directory and name where the meta results will output.

Configuration File
# PRIOR TO RUNNING METAL - make a text file 
## within Terminal, cd to where you want to put the text file and run the NANO command (line 123) changing the filename to reflect your project
```{bash, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# NANO
nano carotid_stenosis_meta_METAL.txt #input this into terminal, then copy the above chunk into the the blank terminal window, press control 'X',then the 'Y' key, then Enter
# Execute METAL in Terminal (don't change the metal-2020-05-05 pathway. Do change the /project/damrauer_shared/Users... pathway to point to where you saved the NANO text file you made above)
